## React Router

`react-router` contains all the common components  
between `react-router-dom` and `react-router-native`.

If you're using **React Native**, `react-router-native` should have everything you need.

If you're on the web then `react-router-dom` should have everything you need as it also exports the common components you'll need.  
`react-router-dom` is a `react-router` plus:  
- `< BrowserRouter >`, which is `<Router history={browserNativeHistoryApiWrapper} / >`
- `< NavLink >`, which is a wrapper that knows if it's **"active"** or not
